## Autism Screening

### Introduction

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that impairs social interpretation/communication ability, as well as the presence of repetitive behaviors. Current diagnostic procedures are lengthy and inefficient [@Fadi]. Affecting 1.5% of the population, with many more cases going undetected, an easy-to-implement, effective screening method is warranted. ASDTest, a mobile app, has been introduced to provide an accessible screening method that tells the user whether they should seek professional healthcare opinions, based on a 10 question survey [@allison2012toward]. The ability to recognize and diagnose ASD at an early age can allow the affected to access the healthcare resources and support they will need, in a timely manner. 

The Autism Spectrum Quotient-10 ([AQ-10](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg142/resources/autism-spectrum-quotient-aq10-test-pdf-186582493)) consists of 10 questions intended to differentiate characteristics of autism in individuals. Each question has four possible answers: "Definitely Agree", "Slightly Agree, "Slightly Disagree", and "Definitely Disagree". For questions 1, 5, 7, and 10, a value of 1 is assigned for either a "slightly agree" or a "definitely agree" response. For questions 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9, a value of 1 is assigned for either a "slightly disagree" or a "definitely. disagree" response. A cumulative score is calculated and a participant who receives a total score of greater than 6 is recommended for a specialist diagnostic assessment.

### Data Description

The [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Autism+Screening+Adult)  used in this analysis was obtained from the University of California Irvine Machine learning Repository, uploaded by Fadi Thabtah. Each row represents an individual who participated in the survey. The survey's results, the app's classification, and some background information about the individual was recorded. Below is the entire variable set:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
